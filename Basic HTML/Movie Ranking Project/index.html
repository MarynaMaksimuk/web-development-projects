<h1>The Best Movies According to Maryna</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-times.</h2>

<h3>Rocky</h3>
<p>As perfect a film as has ever been made, the original 1976 "Rocky" has become part of the pop culture unconscious, holding its spot as tightly as "Casablanca" and "It's a Wonderful Life." It's also as much of a medium-realigning work as the blockbuster that came out one year later, the first "Star Wars" (eventually subtitled "A New Hope"), which was so huge that the industry spent the next twenty years trying to reproduce its success through science fiction and fantasy epics of other types. </p>

<h3>Taken</h3>
<p>If CIA agents in general were as skilled as Bryan Mills in particular, Osama bin Laden would have been an American prisoner since late September 2001. "Taken" shows Mills as a one-man rescue squad, a master of every skill, a laser-eyed, sharpshooting, pursuit-driving, pocket-picking, impersonating, knife-fighting, torturing, karate-fighting killing machine who can cleverly turn over a petrol tank with one pass in his car and strategically ignite it with another.</p>

<h3>Bella</h3>
<p>“I’m not a singer; I’m a dancer!” Bella Lewitzky defiantly refused to answer the House Un-American Activities Committee when they asked if she was a communist. As a result, she was blacklisted, and could no longer appear in the movies that were her primary source of income.  </p>
